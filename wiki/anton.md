When branching code and merging, avoid working on the same section of code, as this usually results in merge conflicts.

Ideally less conflicts occur when developers work on different files at a time, however this is not always possible.

Encapsulation is a very important aspect of working in a project, as this allows for code reusability and clean code. Overall allows for code to be a lot more readable.

JavaDoc comments should always be written when writing a method, as this allows for team members to understand how the code functions.

Everytime a FXML file is edited using sceneBuilder, it reverts the JavaFX to another version. 

Close previous applications of the application, as this occasionally causes the virtual box to crash and perhaps losing some progress that is made.
