My advice to future programmers would be to push as you code as you should already be doing. At some points, the virtual machine crashed which meant that work was lost. By committing frequently, our lost data was easily recovered. 

Planning as extensively as possible will mean that less decisions will need to be made along the way as well as saving time. This is important particularly in design decisions, where the group would use time that could have been used to code on ideation.

Use the practises of object-oriented design as much as possible while coding. The fundamentals of O-O-P have been developed and used extensively for good reason : Because coding with this paradigm in the proper way would improve all areas of coding, particularly in code readability. An example of this would be of the FXML classes that we failed to encapsulate as new classes. 

When coding at the same time, branching is your best friend. Branching allows for easy compilation of the code between all group members.
